# communalBeautify

This is an Android app I built using Android Studio. 

The premise behind this app is that in every communal setting (office, house shared with others), there's that individual that makes a mess ( a spill, dropping food on the floor, etc) and walks away. Passerby walks by with apathy as the effort to report the mess to the one responsible for cleaning is too great. This app makes is easy to record the "mess" by a simple entry and picture using your phone and sharing it to the proper person (custodian in a building, etc). 

Also, this app allows one to report an improvement in a communal setting to the right authority (building manager of an apartment, business service manager of a company, etc). The idea is the same as reporting a 'mess' where one makes and entry, takes a picture, and simply sending(email, facebook, messenger, etc) it off. 


I used fragments for the view layouts and SQlite to store the individual record.
